# CloudSystems

A landing page for a fictional company called Cloud Systems where they host any type of software and business.

# Motivation

I really enjoy seeing modern landing pages for companies. The design that gets put into and the subtle yet nice animations that bring the website to life. I decided to see if I could build a modern landing page for a company. I am not a UI/UX designer so the way I built this page was through the design of others that I've seen.
